here's a free public hack you can use to execute alot of scripts :-).
it uses a great vast vulnerability that currently exists,
so while you take advantage of it I can work on my CLVM and also my other vulnerability thats actually pretty
good lol, and cant be patched! 8-)

literally just paste the Lua_API in your empty DLL project.
and then do this: paste dllmain.cpp in your empty DLL project too.

that's all you have to do omg.

Then hit run.
you will literally be amazedddd

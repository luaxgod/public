here's a free public hack you can use to execute alot of scripts :-).
it uses a great vast vulnerability that currently exists,
so while you take advantage of it I can work on my CLVM and also my other vulnerability thats actually pretty
good lol, and cant be patched! 8-)

literally just paste the Lua_API in your empty DLL project.
and then do this: paste dllmain.cpp in your empty DLL project too.

that's all you have to do omg.

Then hit run. Oh ya before you do that, set the "Debug" option to "Release".
and also fix the project settings; the comments at the top of dllmain.cpp will explain how.
ok and now inject the DLL.
you will literally be amazedddd

it's all yours; the whole shabang

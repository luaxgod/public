here's a free public hack you can use to execute alot of scripts :-).
it uses a great vast vulnerability that currently exists,
so while you take advantage of it I can work on my CLVM and also my other
vulnerability thats actually far greater lol, and cant be patched! 8-)

literally just paste the Lua_API in a DLL project.
and then do this: paste dllmain.cpp in the DLL project too.
Do the empty DLL project that comes with stdafx.h and that stuff already set up,
but follow the instructions in dllmain.cpp.

that's all you have to do omg.

and before you hit run, set the "Debug" option to "Release".
ok and now inject the DLL.
you will literally be amazedddd

if you get kicked just rejoin and try again; I include an anti-log.

it's all yours; the whole shabang
